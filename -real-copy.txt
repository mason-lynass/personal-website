I spent a day at Johnny Goss' Dandelion Gold studio to record every small & handheld percussion instrument I own (and a few of Johnny's things too). We recorded more than 60 instruments with a wide variety of microphones. I poured over the audio we recorded to cut one shots and loops, then organized everything into a cohesive, high quality sample pack.

We used an AEA R88 mk2, a WA-251, a U67, and a pair of MXL V67s to record all of these instruments:
